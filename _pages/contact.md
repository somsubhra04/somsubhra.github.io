<!-- *If you wish to discuss something related to Academics, kindly write to my IITM domain email address.* -->

You can also find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/somsubhrad/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/somsubhraspeaks) and [FB](https://facebook.com/somsubhra2004).

Few thoughts:
Friends, Feel free to contact me regarding acad, collabs etc!

The best way to get in touch with me is via email.
Generally I won't engage in discussions over Whatsapp, Twitter or FB if I don't know you personally. Kindly use my personal email for communication.


If you're someone from IITM, kindly login through your institute G account to access this [page]() that I had created for one of my course activities. Kindly use the Gsite contact feature present at the bottom corner to deliver your message to my semail which will assure me that the email is genuine.

(You might have already understood that I take cyber security seriously and don't reply to 'outside the organisation' emails that are anonymous or seem to be misleading! ðŸ˜€ Can't help. With an increasing number of such cases, this is the least that can be done from my side!)
