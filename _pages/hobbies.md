Beyond my academic pursuits, I love to keep myself engaged in a diverse range of extracurricular activities like listening to music, going through the science and tech Twitter feeds, writing English and Bangla blogs and poems. I love exploring new places through travel and capturing moments that evoke emotions and tell stories. I'm also into Science popularization. During the pandemic, I had started a programme called 'eVigyan' where I teamed up with some of my friends to conduct fun and interactive activities like quizzes, coming up with newsletters on science and coding to inspire high school students about STEM education. I was awarded the Best Initiative Award from AI4Youth (jointly run by Intel and CBSE) platform.

During my junior school years in 2014, I used to participate in several writing competitions. I secured the 2nd position in a poetry competition organized by Telekids, The Telegraph's creative column for the youngsters. This was my first opportunity to showcase my creativity and it was indeed an unbeleivable and cherishable moment, waking up to see my poetry published in the newspaper. I was also one of the winners of an article writing contest organized by Odisha Positive in 2021.
