Beyond my academic pursuits, I love to keep myself engaged in a diverse range of extracurricular activities like listening to music, going through the science and tech Twitter feeds, writing English and Bangla blogs and poems. I love exploring new places through travel and capturing moments that evoke emotions and tell stories. I'm also into Science popularization. During the pandemic, I had started a programme called 'eVigyan' where I teamed up with some of my friends to conduct fun and interactive activities like quizzes, coming up with newsletters on science and coding to inspire high school students about STEM education. I was awarded the Best Initiative Award from AI4Youth (jointly run by Intel and CBSE) platform.
