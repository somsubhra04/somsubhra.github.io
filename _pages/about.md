Hi! I am Saikiran, I recently finished my undergraduate in the Computer Science and Engineering department of [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) (2018-22). 
In Fall 2022, I'll be joining [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://inf.ethz.ch/) for an MSc in Computer Science. 
I'm currently interested in machine learning, computer vision, and fairness & interpretability in ML.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
