Hi! I am Saikiran, I recently finished my undergraduate in the Computer Science and Engineering department of [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) (2018-22). 
In Fall 2022, I'll be joining [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://inf.ethz.ch/) for an MSc in Computer Science. 
I'm currently interested in machine learning, computer vision, and fairness & interpretability in ML.

I did my Bachelors' thesis with Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) and Prof. [Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) on self-supervised multimodal learning. 
In the summer of 2021, I was a data science intern at Microsoft, where I worked on vision-language models for Bing ads classification with [Swati Tiwari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swati-tiwari-1805/) and [Neelesh Khanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nekhanna/).
The summer before, I was exploring Vector Addition Systems as a research intern at ENS Paris-Saclay, guided by Prof. [Alain Finkel](http://www.lsv.fr/~finkel/). 

I'm avid listener and learner of Carnatic music (South Indian classical). I also enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/skeleton-detective) and swimming.
