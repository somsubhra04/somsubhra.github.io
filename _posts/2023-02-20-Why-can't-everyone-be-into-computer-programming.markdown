## Why can't everyone be a programmer *(or could they)?*

Maybe? but why **Not**?

Programming is a long journey and just like all other professions, it requires time, patience,passion,and a very big well to learn and for many reasons.

- Programmers aren't just coding, They are maintaining, Debugging, Testing, Creating better ideas for code or even optimizing it for newer Generations of computers.

- Programming is not an easy task and that's why programmers/Developers are sometimes paid better than some professions.

- They spend so long time in front of the screen for most of the day Coding which is unhealthy in both physical and mental matter.

- Understanding the Client's demands and ideas is really necessary and should be studied carefully before beginning to code.

- Program -> idea -> situations/problems -> flowchart -> code, not everyone can do this at least that what i saw from my classmate in university.

- Not everyone can be a #1 dev from day one, it requires fine tuning every aspect of you knowledge in programming and then deploying it in it's right way.

Finally please understand this; all the professions are equal, none are better nor are worse
everyone is excel in thier own way, some are very awesome in cooking, others?, Artists,Enginners,Doctors,Lawyers and judges and also many others like sewers cleaning, Street cleaners, These Wonderful people are the reason why our society is clean, built, stable, and thriving; Everyone is Important in there own place with there own profession so we should respect everyone for better tommorow
